The reader code for IAESTEs readers

Its important to put the two .dll files in lib into your Java JDK folder, under bin!!
It wont run if you dont do that! You will get a cryptic error message.

Also, dependent on which OS you run, you have to checkout the right branch.
The master branch have the x64 files need to run the system.
While the branch windows32 have the x86 files needed to run the system.

So if you run a windows32, please clone the project, checkout windows32 and use those .dll files from the lib.
Its very important!
